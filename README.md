Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge
==========
The goal of this challenge is to identify which simulated ATLAS experiment proton-proton collision observations contain evidence of boson pairs ("signal"), and which do not ("background").

See the Summary for exploratory data analysis and submissions for prediction attempts.
